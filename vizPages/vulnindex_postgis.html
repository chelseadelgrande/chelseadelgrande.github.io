              <h1>Vulnerability and Suitability Analysis in Wade Hampton Census Tract’s Alaska Native Areas (ANAs) Using PostGIS Spatial Database  </h1>
    
                <p>Climate changes in Alaska have become a rising issue for Alaska Native Areas (ANAs) since the 1980s. Temperatures in Alaska have risen 3.5 degrees Celsius since the 1950s, which is twice the global average (Bronen, 2013). Consequently, rising temperatures and snow cover change have induced natural thawing of permafrost, which has led to accelerated rates of erosion and flooding. Historically, permafrost kept the subsoil structure frozen and intact, particularly around coastal communities. As permafrost melts, coastal communities, and particularly ANAs, face the impacts of flooding and erosion, ultimately threating the physical infrastructure of homes, schools and healthcare facilities. Due to climate induced changes in the ANA communities, ANAs are looking at relocation options for their villages.  </p>

            <div class="col-md-12 about-info">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Previous studies (my capstone) used a tract level ANA Vulnerability Index (ANAVI) and identified the Wade Hampton Census Area as the most vulnerable tract to socioeconomic and environmental variables between 2006 and 2016. This study will serve to identify the socioeconomic and environmental suitability of the 19 ANAs that intersect the Wade Hampton Area. Additionally, the database will serve to identify potential suitable tabblocks for ANAs who seek relocation for their village due to climate impacts.</p>
                <p>Changes in the physical land structure and community development characteristics play a major role in the devastation affecting ANAs, which force government agencies to intervene in their communities with risk assessment mechanisms. Flooding and erosion pose a looming environmental threat to the 213 ANAs, particularly coastal villages (Bronen 2013). Increasing air temperature has resulted in rising sea levels due to decreasing Arctic ice extent. Additionally, changes in migration patterns due to federal and state government development in the villages has left communities tied to infrastructure in one location rather than historical migratory locations. As ANAs face flooding and infrastructure destruction in their current geographic boundaries, government agencies, including the Government Accountability Office (GAO), are assessing the impacts and defining protection mechanisms and relocation efforts for the most impacted ANAs (Bronen 2013). </p>
                <p>The two major variables that affect the physical landscape of ANAs are flooding and erosion. Across Alaska, the depletion of permafrost due to warmer temperatures is affecting the integrity of the community landscape. Permafrost holds soil intact, but as it melts, the soil erodes, and infrastructure and sewage systems sink. Coastal communities are more vulnerable to floods and storms as Arctic sea ice melts. Historically, sea ice protected ANAs from winds off the coast, but depleting ice caps have increased winds and overall destruction to their infrastructure during storm events (Bronen 2013).</p>
                <p>Another issue that has impacted the livelihood of ANA communities is their reliance on government built public facilities, which turned communities away from their historic patterns of migration. Migration patterns changed in the 19th Century when the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Education required that children attend school. With this, government-built infrastructure including power plants, schools, health facilities and airports established permanent ANA communities (Bronen 2013). Consequently, the destruction of public facilities from climate-based impacts increased the overall impact of the damages since the infrastructure has increased in value to the communities over time. Overall, the transition to permanent communities has limited the ANAs’ ability to adapt to climate-based physical changes in their landscape and are now facing destruction of the infrastructure they rely on for education, healthcare and housing.  </p>
                <p>While ANAs have been assessing the impacts of erosion and flooding on their land since the 1980s, state and federal government agencies are now also seeking protection mechanism for their communities. In 2003, the GAO reported that flooding and erosion affects 86% of the ANAs (Bronen 2013). Additionally, the GAO and U.S. Army Corps identified the seven most affected villages (Dillingham, Bethel, Kivalina, Kaktovik, Shishmaref, Newtok and Unalakleet), and determined the viability and cost efficiency of erosion protection plans versus relocation efforts for each village, rising as high as $95 million for the relocation one village. The State of Alaska also intervened, developing an Immediate Action Workgroup (IAWG) to determine the needs of the ANAs, and the impacts of climate-based effects on the communities. Therefore, climate change related impacts on the physical landscape and infrastructure of ANAs are now requiring intervention from federal and state governments to evaluate risk assessment and relocation plans moving forward (Bronen 2013).   </p>

            <h2>Study Area</h2>
            <p>Alaska contains 167 tracts and 213 Alaska Native Areas. The census tract is a geographic boundary that holds a population count between 1,200 – 8,000 in standard statistical areas, and between 480 and 3,200 in tribal census tract (“Census Tracts for the 2020 Census-Final Criteria” 2018). Census tracts are relatively permanent small-area geographic divisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity defined for the tabulation and presentation of data from the decennial census and other statistical programs. In Alaska, the average tract area is 1246.04 square miles and an average population of 604 residents per tract (“Census Tracts for the 2020 Census-Final Criteria” 2018). The low population threshold in Alaska is due to the mix of standard and tribal statistical tract areas.  </p>
            <p>In Alaska, the American Indian Areas are defined as Alaska Native Areas (ANAs), which cover two federally recognized and statistic tribal boundaries: Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) and Alaska Native Village Statistical Areas (ANVSAs). Alaska contains 12 ANRCs, which are regional corporations that serve for-profit and non-profit affairs of the tribal residents (“American Indian Areas (AIAs) Program for the 2010 Census-Notice of Final Criteria and Guidelines” 2008). ANVSAs hold the statistical boundary of densely populated tribal residents of an Alaska Native Village (ANV). Residents of ANSAs are either members of the corresponding ANV or are receiving government services from the ANV (“American Indian Areas (AIAs) Program for the 2010 Census-Notice of Final Criteria and Guidelines” 2008).  </p>

            <h2>Conceptual Framework | ER Diagram </h2>
            <p>The components of the PostGIS database are shown in Figure 3. Overall, tracts include ANAs, and ANAs hold the variables we are most interested in (percent poverty, school enrollment, high school graduates, health insured, population and housing units). Additionally, land use land cover (LULC) is derived for each ANA boundary, while rise sink areas and rivers intersect the ANA boundaries. This helps identify what factors might negatively impact an ANA. </p>
            <p>To identify potential relocation tabblocks, ANAs also have a one to one relationship with tabblocks, and tabblocks contain streets and airports, which are desirable attributes of a new location. </p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>In order to utilize data in a PostGIS database, the tables needed to be cleaned and processed with the appropriate column fields. The below methods were used.</p>
            <p>Slope along River Buffer: The Zone of influence that effects erosion along rivers in Alaska is determined to be 100 meters. Therefore, the Buffer Tool is used in ArcMap to create a 100 meter buffer around the rivers in the most vulnerable tract from the ANAVI. The DEM is loaded into the Slope Tool in ArcMap, then Zonal Statistics are used to determine the AIAs with the largest amount of slope changes within 100 meters of a river. </p>
            <p>Raster Landsat and Sentinnel Aerial Imagery: Since clouds are present within the datasets, atmospheric correction is used to account for scattering using the Dark Subtract Tool in ENVI. Additionally, images with 10% cloud coverage are given masks to remove the lack of accurate data in the clouded areas. 16 Landsast images and 31 Sentinnel images are mosaicked with 50 pixel seamlines using the Mosaic Tool in ENVI to account for the Wade Hampton Census Tract, the most vulnerable tract. The images are masked to the ANA boundaries using the Build Mask Tool in ENVI, to focus the LULC change on the ANA geography. Additionally, stich seams are masked so the No Data values to not corrupt the classification pixel values.</p>
            <p>Unsupervised ISODATA Classification: Given the range of land cover types throughout the 19 ANAs, unsupervised classification is the best method to capture the different landscapes across 19 areas. ISODATA uses class means evenly distributed across space, then iterates the remaining pixels given their relationship to the means (“ISODATA” n.d.). Each iteration recalculates the means and reclassifies means with respect to the new means until pixels in each class change by less than the selected pixel change threshold, or the number of maximum iterations is met. The 2006 and 2016 data uses a maximum of eight classes with six iterations. An eight class threshold is used to ensure that all necessary classes are captured for classification. </p>
            <p>To understand the different landscapes, the eight classes are explored with the ENVI Post Classification Class Statistics Tool and by toggling on and off the areas while zoomed in and comparing to the aerial imagery. Additionally, Google Maps is used to get an understanding of the ground truth, since Google Maps uses a finer resolution than Landsat and Sentinnel imagery. </p>
            <p>The final ISODATA classification used five classes (water, marsh, dry land, grass/low vegetation, and vegetation) for 2006 and 2016. </p>
            <p>Converting ENVI Results to ArcMap: Data is migrated from ENVI into ArcMap to identify the area of LULC change over time throughout each ANA boundary. To bring data into ArcMap, the ENVI Classification to Vector, Vector to ROI, and Classic ROI to Shapefile tools are used. This ensures the data is in the proper format for use in ArcMap. In ArcMap, the 2006 and 2016 shapefiles are joined to the ANA variable shapefiles shown in Table 9 using the Spatial Join Tool. The LULC change is the input feature area, and the ANA variables are the join features with a one to many relationship. The LULC change difference is calculated for each land cover type in each ANA boundary by subtracting the 2006 LULC change in square meters from the 2016 LULC change in square meters. This will be used in PostGIS to identify the amount of change over time.</p>
            <p>Importing Data to PostGIS: Shapefiles were imported to a PostGIS table using the PostGIS 2.0 Shapefile and DBF Loader Exporter with an SRID of 4326, to ensure the data was projected. Next, the data needed to answer the following questions.</p>

            <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
            <p>The analysis provides insight on the socioeconomic and environmental factors that impact the communities. The study shows that in terms of socioeconomic factors, Scammon Bay displayed the most vulnerability, with 54.2% poverty, 39% school enrollment, 51.7% high school graduates and with 99% of the population carrying health insurance. Additionally, Pilot Station and Hooper Bay showed similar socioeconomic status. Scammon Bay and Hooper Bay are coastal communities, therefore it was important to look at the environmental factors as well. </p>

            <p>The environmental factors showed that Hooper Bay, Chevak and Scammon Bay were the most vulnerable to environmental factors, with these areas containing the closest distance to rivers and the highest slope near rivers. It is also important to note that they are all located in the same area of the Wade Hampton Census Tract, therefore provide geographic support for their level of environmental vulnerability. </p>

            <p>Additionally, the difference in LULC change was assessed to draw a correlation between the results in the socioeconomic and environmental variables. Here you can see the pixel changes between 2006 and 2016 by each land cover class. Overally, Algaaciq and Mountain Village shoed the largest LULC change between 2006 and 2016. This did not provide consistent results with the socioeconomic and environmental variables.</p>

            <h2>Web App</h2> 
            <p>A PHP file connects to the PostGIS database tables and fields by enabling the pgsql and pdo_sql extensions in the php.ini file, and then connecting to the PostGIS database through a pg_connect(host, port, dbname, user, pwrd) call. </p>
            <p>The PHP script calls the PostGIS database with a ST_AsGEOJsON(ST_Transform(geom, 4326)) to convert the data into projected GeoJSON layers, which can be read by Leaflet. On success, each feature in the data table is added to a data array through an onEachFeature() function. The data from the tables are bound to a popup window for each time an ANA is clicked with a Layer.bindPopup(html) function. </p>
            <p>PHP functionality reads user input, when an AIA is read on the client side ($aia), and then feeds the PostGIS database to return the user needs from the server side. Additional html tags linked with PHP will allow for the user to return tabblocks that fit a desired outcome for relocation suitability, using the following SQL query. An example of the app and the popup information is shown below. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>  
            <p>Overall, the coastal communities of Scammon Bay, Hooper Bay and Chevak appeared to be the most consistently impacted by environmental variables. Additionally, Scammon Bay and Hooper Bay both ranked highest for socioeconomic vulnerability. Based on literature review, coastal communities appear most impacted by climate changes, therefore the results are not surprising. The LULC change did not support the results, and therefore, may require reclassification editing to build a more accurate LULC change comparison. The tabblock universe serves as a starting point for identifying tabblocks that might be viable for relocation. Further information should be included into the queries that is supported by literature review. </p>
