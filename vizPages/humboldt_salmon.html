              <h1>A Study on Chinook Salmon in Humboldt, Trinity, Del Norte and Siskiyou Counties, CA &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Impacts of Elevation and Land Cover on Abundance, and Determining a Suitable Management Area</h1>
    
                <p>West Coast Chinook Salmon stocks have declined substantially in recent years due to a myriad of impacts on their habitat; this study analyzed existing abundance data between 1992 and 2005 in attempts to draw connectivity between elevation and land cover type with stock abundance decline trends in four northern California counties: Humoldt, Trinity, Del Norte and Siskiyou. The conclusion of the initial analysis helps determine the best location for a conservation area within the region.  </p>

                <p>Chinook Salmon are native to northern California and play a large role in the local ecosystem, but are currently facing declining population trends due to a multitude of impacts to their habitat: loss of stream habitat due to watershed disturbances, interactions with hatchery fish, overexploitation and climactic factors (Brown 251). While there are multiple factors that are known to contribute to the decline of Chinook salmon population, this analysis focused on the main disturbance factors local to Humboldt, Trinity, Del Norte and Siskiyou counties: loss of stream habitat due to watershed disturbances associated with urbanization, logging, and mining. Increasing land development, and continued logging operations create excess sediment from soil erosion and logging roads in steep sloped areas, which impact gravel permeability and increase sediment into watersheds (Brown 252). The excess sediment seeps into streams and traps salmonid and their eggs by reducing intragravel flow and dissolved oxygen. Therefore, both elevation and land cover are known to be determining factors that impact the longevity of salmon populations in the region.</p>
                <p>One of the major limiting factors for assessing the salmonid decline in northern California is the lack of recorded historic data for the region’s population. A majority population estimates in northern California are a range of population estimates, and expanded redd estimates beginning in 2010 (NOAA Fisheries, 12). Due to a short time duration, these estimates fall short of creating a conclusive connectivity between causation and distribution trend decline. This analysis used existing fish abundance data that was recorded between 1992 and 2005 in a new attempt to show the status of the Chinook salmonid abundance, and draw a possible correlation between elevation and specific land cover type with population status. </p>
                <p>The objective of this project is to identify strong correlations between elevation and a specific land cover type (urban, agriculture, barren or natural) with Chinook fish abundance in Humboldt, Trinity, Del Norte and Siskiyou counties in Norhtern California between 1992 and 2005. The initial results will furhter inform the placement of a proposed monitoring and conservation area to preserve areas along streambanks that are most affected by land cover and elevation</p>

Prepare elevation datasets: </b> I merged and clipped DEM files to county boundaries, then found the slope and created a buffer 100 meters around Chinook abundance. I used 100 meters because this is the generally accepted distance from streams that is known to impact acquatic wildlife. I then found the “Zonal Statistics” for Chinook abundance buffer zones between  1992 - 2000, and 2001 - 2005 to identify the mean  of cells in the DEM that correlate with the buffer zones of Chinook abundance.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><b>2. Prepare NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001 datasets:</b> I clipped NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001 to county boundaries, then reclassified land cover into four categories: 1. Urban 2. Barren 3. Natural 4. Agriculture. Note: “NoData” is not included in the analysis; “Open Water “and “Perennial Ice” are classified as “NoData” as this project focuses on land surface. I created a 100 meter buffer around Chinook abundance on reclassified NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001 then used “Tabulate Area” to find the percentage of land cover type within each cell of the 100 meter buffer for NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001.</li>

I split the data into two sections: 1992 - 2000 and 2001 - 2005. For this project we assume that NLCD does not change until a new map is provided; therefore 1992 - 2000 abundance was matched with 1992 NLCD, and 2001 - 2005 abundance was matched with 2001 NLCD.  </li>

                <p>I was surprised by the results above, specifically Fig. 8, so I decided to break up my variables to better understand the data and results. Fig 9 shows the connection between only natural land cover and Chinook abundance, and omits slope in the equation. The plot reveals that even though there is a positive trend between fish population and natural land cover, the high amount of 0 counts skews the data and brings the trendline down. This highlights the need for a more powerful model that weighs 0 counts appropriately for this scenario.</p>

                <p>Fig 10 shows the connection between only elevation and Chinoook abundance, and removes land cover as a factor. The results show that higher fish counts reside in areas with lower elevation. Additionally, the very low P-value shows that we have high confidence that slope affects Chinook abundance in this scenario. While this was an expected outcome, it only explains one variable to understanding Chinook abundance. This model does not tell us why elevation has an impact on Chinook abundance.</p>

                <h1>Proposed Management Area</h1>
                <p>Based on my results that highlight slope as an influencing factor in declining Chinook abundance, I propose creating a management area along the North Fork Dillon Creek tributary (Fig 11). The 100 meter buffer area around North Fork Dillon Creek contains the steepest slope  out of all streams in Humboldt, Trinity, Del Norte and Siskiyou. The slope in this area ranges from 39.932m - 71.2896m,  where the mean slope for the four counties is 17.557 m, with a standard deviation of 10.98 m. </p>
                <p>Therefore, I propose monitoring Chinook abundance in this area yearly at consistent time of year, with similar techniques and duration. This area should be conserved in an effort to limit the decline of Chinook as it is most vulnerable to watershed disruption due to erosion and increased sediment on a steep slope. </p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The linear regression results were surprising, and did not draw conclusive connectivity between Chinook abundance, elevation and land cover type interaction.  The statistics generally show low confidence that Chinook abundance is affected by elevation and land cover type in these models.  While Fig. 10 highlights confidence that slope has an impact on fish abundance, it does not explain the results with another variable such as land cover type. This theory is supported by literature, and it can be assumed that slope corresponds with high eroision, and increased water sediment, which negatively affects salmonid health. </p>
                <p>When I compared Chinook abundance to one x variable, natural land cover, the plot revealed a major issue skewing my results: the high 0 counts. Moving forward, it would be interesting to see how a zero inflated modeling approach would change my results.  This would take away the high impact of 0 counts, and focus on the higher quality data. Based on the results , it is not unreasonable to note that land cover might not impact Chinook abundance in this scenario. </p>
                <p>Based on the results between two variable interaction, and one variable interaction with Chinook abundance, it is not unreasonable to note that land cover type might affect Chinook abundance as we were able to draw results from elevation, but found no significant results from land cover, or the two variable interaction.</p>
                <p>Additionally, it is worth noting that data collection may have an impact on the results. Lack of fish count data is currently a major limiting factor to understanding negative impacts on salmonid health. This model attempted to use existing available data to draw connectivity between land cover and salmonid health. Unfortunately, when the data was properly clipped and grouped, it only accounted for 111 observations between 1992 and 2005. Therefore, there is a high chance of misrepresented data for 111 observations over 13 years. Therefore, consistent yearly data in these streams would benefit the analysis for understanding affects on Chinook abundance.</p>
                <p>Altogether, I propose implementing a conservation and monitoring site at North Fork Dillon Creek tributary as it is surrounded by the highest slope within a 100 meter buffer compared to the other streams in Humboldt, Trinity, Del Northe and Siskiyou counties. </p>
