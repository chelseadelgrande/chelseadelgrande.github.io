          <h1>NINEWA PLAINS &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Conflict and Stabilization: How Religious and Ethnic Populations Perceive their Environment</h1>

          <p>Religious and ethnic populations in Iraq have faced persecution since the rise of ISIS. The United States Institute of Peace conducted a study surveying
              a range of local residents and IDPs to best understsand how they perceive their environments over time as it relates to 
              safe and secure environments, political moderation and stable governance, rule of law and social wellbeing and livelihoods.
              This analysis utilizes the 90 - 100 surveys conducted over the Ninewa Plains between February 2018 and September 2019.<p>

          <p>This survey was conducted with the intention of driving reconciliation in the Ninewa Plains, given the various religious and political dynamics in the region. reconciliation
            focuses on the need to repair the social fabric in the post-ISIS period through critical stabilization efforts. This analysis provides a basis for a long-term process by which parties build trust, learn 
            to live cooperatively, and create a stable environment.

          <h1>WAVE I TRENDS &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; March 2018 Conflict and Stabilization Survey</h1>

          <p>Yezidis in Al-Shamal reported the highest marginalization in their communities, and the least amount of confidence in institutions, which 
            directly impacted their views of identity in their communities. Alternatively, Arabs recognized that other groups were marginalized, and generally
            felt more comfortable with their environment. Arabs in Zummar, Al Shamal, Tilkaef and Hamdaniya all agreed that 
            others in their subdistrict were marginalized, but did not necessarily believe their group was marginalized.    <p>

          <p>Additionally, a majority of Arabs and Kurds in Al-Shamal and Tilkaef, and Shabak in Hamdaniya identify with a national identity. This is not surprising as these groups also had stronger trust in provincial and central institutions, and believed the government was responsive to their needs.

      <h1>Wave III Trends &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; September 2019 Conflict and Stabilization Survey</h1>

      <p>In addition to Yezidis, Arabs in Al Shamal, Sinjar and Al-Ayadiya reported a perception that their groups were marginalizedin
        in the third wave of surveys. While Arabs in Sinjar did not respond in Wave I, in Wave III, they reported that they believed that others in their subdistrict were margnialized. Arabs
        and Kurds in Zummar were the most receptive, reporting that other groups had legitimate political concerns. In an increase from 
        2018, Arabs in Al-Shamal recognized that political leaders were polarizing. <p>

      <p>Yezidi's in Al-Shamal notably gained national identity over the period between waves. In March 2018, 55% of Yezidis reported 
        that they had a strong sense of national identity, while the September 2019 survey showed that identity increased to 80%.

      <h1>FINDINGS ACROSS TIME &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Reconciliation / Social Cohesion</h1>

      <p>Reconciliation is needed, but obstaccles exist that are preventing it from advancing. In all locations surveyed, the majority of respondents believe that there is a need for 
        reconciliation between and/or among communities. Some communities believe it is not within reach due to lack of political will, desire, knowledge and competence.<p>

      <p>There is a growing sense of sectarianism and isolation among Christians in Hamdaniya and Yazidis in Sinjar. Both communities are more inclined to view the heterogeneous composition
        of their districts as something that causes more harm than good. Additionally, both believe that their interests would be better advanced by ethno-sectarian political parties
        and local (district and sub-district) councils composed of their co-religionists. Christians in Hamdaniya do not want IDPs from other communities to return.</p> 

      <p>Perceptions of mistrust are common across identity groups, but the mistrust is acknowledge as legitimate grievances. </p>
      <p>Many in minority communities feel that the state has ignored their suffering and that it is not acting in the interest of communities. Most respondents view decisions and policies of the government as 
        insufficient in addressing their particular needs in the area.
