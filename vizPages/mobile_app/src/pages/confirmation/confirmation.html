          SPRING
          </ion-card-title>
          <ul><li>Pack for warmth. Spring nights are anything but warm, and you need to pack with this in mind. Be sure you have a cold weather sleeping bag for 20 to 40 degree weather. Even if it doesn't get quite that cold, it's best to be prepared.</li>
            <li>An all-weather tent will work for springtime camping, but make sure to pack a tarp as well. You never know when you'll see spring showers. </li>
            <li>You'll find a sleeping pad is helpful during cold nights. This will give you some space between your body and the ground.</li>
            <li>Pack a waterproof stuff sack to keep your gear nice and dry for your next day's hike.</li>
           </ul>

         SUMMER
          </ion-card-title>
          <ul><li>Block the sun. As the sun rays shine through the doors and the windows of your RV, heat transference will lead to higher temperatures in the space. By blocking the sun around the windows and the doors, you can reduce the heat transference to keep the enclosed space cool.</li>
            <li>Do not cook during peak times. Believe us, you'll regret it! </li>
            <li>Select a lightweight tent. Look out for our summer gear! You'll want that 2 pound tent that won't make you sweat.</li>
            <li>Prepare for mosquitoes. Understand the climate that you will be in, and the native species that are around. You don't want to come back with bites all over your face!</li>
           </ul>
